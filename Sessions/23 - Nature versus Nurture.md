After making sure the ship is likely fine at anchor in a bay, the crew start crossing the beach towards the tree line. They take note of some strange looking flora in the area, sweet scented flowers. The jungle floor is covered with dead leafs. 

Doloris spots movement near some of the local plants. Mal takes a closer look, spotting a small creature with inky black skin with white markings. It teleports, then points at the storm. It then teleports again, appearing atop Doloris’ head. It seems to approve of their plan to move into the forest and they move in.

It teleports again, with Doloris this time, then points them deeper into the jungle. 

The storm eventually hits, though the crew is relatively sheltered underneath the canopy of the trees. The creature guides them further into the jungle. Rayna eventually sees warm light up ahead, likely some form of civilization. They see a building on stilts, built in the sand, which looks like a somewhat fancy place. There’s silhouettes of creatures shambling around, shaped like giant humanoid tortoises. 

They briefly discuss approaching this place, before doing so, Doloris Misty Stepping away from their conversation courtesy of her new charm. One of the tortles steps outside, having noticed their arrival. He wears a number of talisman around his neck. The tortle asks about the ship, Doloris confirming they did arrive here via said ship. 

The tortle asks if Stormbreaker is from the tribe of Taruun, a tribe that lives on this island, near the geysers. It doesn’t ring any bells for Stormbreaker. The tortle then introduces themselves as Uday, welcoming them to the Sanctuary of Perpetual Tides. He then shows them around the place. 

They’re shown to the galley, where food is provided as well. Another tortle, Mudgraw, introduces himself as well. Uday and Mudgraw explain they protect a number of tide pools in the area. They mention rumors that Omgar is the one who causes the storms, but there’s also ones that say the tribe of Storm Giants are to blame. Doloris asks about the snake people, the tortles saying they don’t stay on the islands anymore; they were driven off the island by some Naga.

Uday asks why the crew is here, Doloris telling him they’re on a mission for Melora. Uday shares that there were other people here maybe a month ago, seemed like soldiers. They ask about a trail that starts here; Uday says that the soldiers were also looking for that. He then excuses himself after telling the group where their rooms are for the night. 

Mudgraw returns, asking if any of the group may want some alcohol. He admits that he’s usually the one who leaves this sanctuary to explore the jungle surrounding it. Doloris, T’hau and the captain join him for a drink. Mudgraw shares his seemingly somewhat illegal alcohol with them, then soon excuses himself as he has to get to his shift. Doloris, T’hau and the captain agree that Mudgraw might be a good guide as he’s seen more of the island. They then talk about using the map tomorrow to see if it’ll tell them anything more.

They discuss how much they can trust the tortles, and how they can maybe ask for the recipe of the alcohol. The captain then suggests they should head back to Darktow at some point, to figure out the plan with Nicodranas and Port Damali. 

Meanwhile, Mal, Stormbreaker and Rayna talk about the tribe that was mentioned, Rayna asking if Stormbreaker has a secret brother. Stormbreaker shares he came from Palma Flora, it’s all he knows. He shares that he used to be into surfing, then decided to apply for the navy. They talk about why he decided to do that, and he says he was looking for a purpose. 

He then asks Rayna in turn about where she’s from, and she talks about going to college, Mal helping her cheat, and about why fire has always just felt right to her. 

The captain, Doloris and T’hau head upstairs to rejoin the others and they agree to divide up watches. Stormbreaker takes up the first watch, not much happening during it. He does note that Mudgraw seems to be sleeping on the job. Mal takes second watch. Doloris takes the last watch, heading over to Mudgraw to talk to him. She tries to wake him, but gets no reaction. Two other tortles warn her about not waking him and she picks up on the scent of incense, suddenly feeling light-headed, but she shakes it off. 

One of the other tortles mentions a N’baza, claiming she’s ‘dealing with’ Mudgraw. She draws people into a liminal space of sorts when she needs to have words with them. N’baza leads this cloister; an ancient and very wise Naga. 

Doloris wakes the others and shares what she found out. The crew talks to Mudgraw the following morning, who says he got scolded for drinking on the job. He further says he’s currently without a job, so if the group need a guide he’s happy to offer his services. Rayna asks him about the local flora, to which Mudgraw shares a lot of information. 

Rayna, guided by Mudgraw, goes to find ‘party mushrooms’ after a quick discussion on whether or not the rest of the crew would want some of those. She finds numerous ones, each with different purposes.

Mal finds a room called the Scolarium, where three tortles are copying other books. T’hau and Stormbreaker are asked to help with felling a tree already damaged by last night’s storm. Everyone spends the day getting to know the tortles a little better, until eventually night falls.

Dark clouds appear on the horizon, just like the day before. Then, the cloud seems to split in two, parts of it drifting around the island. The crew pulls out the map and keeps a close eye on the sky. As Doloris pulls the map out of her bag, various symbols on it are lit up. A familiar compass rises from the map, showing an arrow heading north. 
Mal heads back to find Mudgraw, asking for his help to guide the group. They show him the map and start following the arrow. He seems hesitant, admitting that’s goliath territory. He doesn’t necessarily expect trouble, but is still cautious.

They head into the jungle, taking note of deep marks on the trees around them. They start to feel a shake in the ground. They proceed carefully, approaching a clearing. They spot a triceratops, trashing about wildly as two goliath are pelting it with spears. They decide to try and sneak around it. 
As they do, the arrow changes directions, pointing in a slightly different direction now. They adjust their direction, continuing on.

They spot a path, the trunks of trees along it showing patterns of faces with painted expressions. Mudgraw says this path was made by the trees themselves, urging everyone to be on alert. Stormbreaker picks up on a large shape moving amidst the trees, a smell of rotting flesh seemingly surrounding it. 
Stormbreaker rushes it, signalling the start of combat.

They defeat the troll, Rayna Stormbreaker getting the final blow. As they celebrate their win, T’hau and Doloris notice spirits stepping out of the trees. They stare at the crew in awe, seemingly surprised they defeated the troll. It had been troubling them for the last few weeks. They offer the crew a gift: a cloak made of leafs. “This is the Cloak of the Woodland. It will help you move through these trees without getting seen.”

They return to following the map, the spirits of the trees keeping the path open for the group. Once they reach the beach, the trees close up behind them. The map is pointing somewhat to their right, as they keep following it, it seems to point to the mainland. 

In the sand, near where Doloris is standing, Rayna and Stormbreaker notice a glow. 

Mal takes a look at the glow, scooping some of the sand away to reveal what looks to be moonstone. It contains a series of semi circles and lines; an astrolabe. Stormbreaker notices that it isn’t aligned, some of the lines don’t make sense. Mal and Stormbreaker manage to rotate it so that it does make sense. The light coming from the stone becomes brighter and as that happens, the sea in front of them parts.
