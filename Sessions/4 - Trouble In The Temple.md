## The Lady

[[Doloris]] heads into town, towards the temple of Melora. She knows that it can be accessed by sea or the Undercellar. Figuring the nearest entrypoint would be the Blushing Mermaid, from where she can access the Undercellar, Doloris heads there.

Entering the tavern, she sees a life sized wooden mermaid hanging above a reception desk inside, with numerous blackened and withered hands nailed to its body. The place is a confusing maze of interconnected floors that hide dozens of small shabby rooms. There’s a burly looking half-orc behind the bar.

Knowing where the gate can be found in the tunnel, Doloris heads in that direction, but then spots the half-orc looking her way. Instead of continuing through the gate, Doloris approaches the barkeep and asks directions to the temple. Barkeep mentions the Sea Witch, which is considered a derogatory term for the sahuagin in charge of the temple, and Doloris confirms she is the one she intends to speak with.

The barkeep figures she is sincere in her inquiries when he notes the religious symbols of Melora on her armour, and grabs the key to open the rusty gate down. The barkeep does mention that if this gate is locked when she returns, to try one of the other tunnels as there's many ways out of there.

As Doloris enters the tunnel, echoes can be heard up ahead. Down here she figures that is truly a maze, as there are lots of paths and portcullises leading to various places. Eventually she gets to a T intersection where she sees a marking of a staff with the symbol of Melora pointing to the right. Taking the right path, she notices that the water level begins to rise a bit as she eventually reaches a larger room.

This section somewhat different, has a derelict industrial appearance. There are large tubes and pipes that fill the place, stretching large portions of the tunnels. A loud noise can be heard from up ahead, when something metal clanks around on the floor, followed by some curses in Elvish.

Doloris walks around the corner and sees two figures, an angry looking sea elf and a woman. Doloris greets the lady and asks if she is available for a chat. The sea elf seems to be the one that knocked over a brazier with embers a moment ago.

The woman mentions that she isn't taking visitors at this point. Doloris asks to confirm if she is the lady of the temple. The sea elf laughs at the question. The woman excuses Acolyte Lurandell's behaviour and introduces herself as [[Sister Pherria]]. She mentions that the real lady of the temple, [[Lady Sa'hea]], is taken into custody for refusing a direct order of the [[Clovis Concord]]. Doloris offers some help as she introduces herself to the two. Sister Pherria mentions that Lady Sa'hea left this morning to [[Port Damali]] to see the Grand Admiral. She refused the invitation, so they took her by force instead.

Doloris mentions that she wishes to vanquish the oppression in [[Nicodranas]]. Acolyte Lurandell scoffs at the question, sarcastically asking how [[Doloris]] wants to do that. Then Doloris mentions the Revelry. The two attendants of the temple give the impression that Doloris isn't the first one to make such a suggestion.

[[Sister Pherria]] says that a couple of people came to the temple earlier and intend to use it as a smuggling route. Believes they didn't belong to the Revelry, but to the Myriad instead. They were way more rude and called her a sea hag, claiming that they would eventually bow to their demands. Doloris tries to gain their trust by offering her help, and offers to build a mutually beneficial relationship. Sister Pherria seems interested, but isn't too sure if it's entirely agreeable, but is open to meeting the rest of the crew to discuss it. Sister Pherria mentions that the Myriad intends to show up later that day with wares to smuggle through the temple's tunnels, without their explicit approval. Sister Pherria suggests we might be able to help out by returning to the temple later that day and confront them about their intentions.

## Revelations at the Helm & Cloak

The others at the stake-out location decide that they have seen enough here and decide on the next steps. The plan is to get to the Helm & Cloak and see what we can learn from the Golden Chain and Zhelezo folk that frequent the place. We try to exit the building stealthily, but Mal trips on her way out and T'hau manages to catch her, as some Golden Chain guards turn their gaze towards us. T'hau masks her against the building with their carapace turning into the same stone colour as the wall, until the guards turn their attention away from us.

We manage to sneak out and head into White Cliffs, a fairly nice neighbourhood only second to the Opal Archways. When we get to the Helm & Cloak, we can see it looks like three buildings combined into one, with two turrets on either end.

The terrace has a quite number of people still in uniform, enjoying their drinks in the sun. We head inside to get some drinks, and see there are fewer people inside. Big dwarf is running the bar, he's almost bald, has a short well kept beard, and tattooed knuckles in dwarven script. Bartender says lots of [[Golden Chain]] folks hiring rooms in the tavern recently, as some of them are not very happy with housing situation near the vault.

T'hau orders everyone a round of drinks and we head outside to find a free table on the terrace. We engage in light conversation as [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] try to pick up on some conversations around them. Mal hears two [[Golden Chain]] guards talk about a party. A quick chat with the guards reveals that in 12 days time there is a great feast to celebrate the completion of the fortress, where we know the vault is located. Apparently, all the [[Golden Chain]] guards are invited, figuring out that guard presence will be at a minimum.

Suddenly, we hear someone call out "Lou" behind us. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] turns around as she recognises the voice. She turns around and sees a female Zhelezo guard asking what she is doing here, and mentions that Mal's parent's say she died. Mal scoffs at her parents, saying that they are liars. It is in this moment that the rest of us learn that Mal's actual name is Louise.

The Zhelezo guard introduces herself as Ava to the crew, and then asks what Mal is doing here in [[Nicodranas]]. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] mentions that she's here on trading business. Ava shares that work is busy, lots of Myriad activity in the city, Restless Wharf and the Skew councillors have spewed on folk to protests. The [[Golden Chain]] apparently has been a great help to the [[Zhelezo]] and [[Clovis Concord|Concord]]. Mal's parents put in a good word for Ava, and as such is able to work in the Open Quay. After a quick chat, Ava then excuses herself and leaves us alone, mentions she rents a room her. 

As soon as Ava has left, [[T'hau]] and [[Stormbreaker]] turn to [[Mallory Calder|Mal]], asking what that was about. Mal mentions that it's a long story, involving going to hell. Short version is that she wanted a fresh start for herself, so she used a fake name to not attract any unwanted attention.

After a few more drinks, we leave the Helm & Cloak terrace and meet back up with [[Doloris]] on the ship. Doloris inquires about our day and learns that we heard about the party, figuring it is an opportune moment to steal the gold in the vault. When Doloris asks about how we intend to actually smuggle the gold out, [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] replies that we haven't worked out that part yet but we're working on it. Doloris mentions she has a lead, but we might have to fight the [[Myriad]] for it. 

Doloris tells about what she heard at the temple, and mentions temple can't fend for themselves. We might gain some trust with the temple, if we could help the temple by fighting off the Myriad who intend to use the temple's tunnels through the Undercellar forcefully. As the Myriad is quite a fierce competitor of [[The Revelry]], we would both be gaining a favour with the temple and fend off a direct competitor.

## The Briarblaze Heart

During the following night, [[Doloris]] has a dream. She finds herself on a derelict crumbling wooden ship sailing over the water. It is helmed by a faceless creature in a massive black cloak. Darkness surrounds her, ambient green light coming from the bottom of the water. Looking out, she recognises this as the familiar waters of the river Styx. Doloris spots a shape in the water, with a shroud covering the face, and wet crumpled angelic wings coming out from the back. Doloris hears a voice in her head, saying "It is you again child. Have you deciphered it yet?". The shape in the water changes into a flame made out of hands reaching towards a light, with a briar crown underneath, similar to the symbol on the Ki'nau scroll we found in the box. 

![[briar-crown.png]]

The voice then tells Doloris: "The Briarblaze Heart was conjured to remain a secret. Only the followers of Avandra might lay eyes upon her. Thus, was the decree of our lady." Doloris asks if this means she does not have permission to decipher it. The figure says the ones we took it from are also looking, and rather has Doloris find it than them. Spirit starts sinking into the depths again, telling Doloris "The Briarblaze must remain intact".

Then Doloris wakes up and gets out of bed to find the scroll with the calendar. She takes the scroll and gets up to the deck to get some fresh air, but is disappointed when she discovers it is extremely foggy at this time of the night. Sighing under her breath that she can't even peer out over the sea, she decides to return back to bed. Below deck, she bumps into Captain Sariel who mentions he's an early riser. Inquiring if the captain knows something about the fog, the captain mentions that the fog come in every night from the waters surrounding [[Nicodranas]]. Seems to be a relic from the city's trip to Avernus. Doloris then greets the captain goes back to bed again.

## So, is it Louise now?

We wake up and get some breakfast. [[Doloris]] asks [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] if she wants to take another look at the map later. Mal's name comes up again, with [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] suggesting there’s more to it than just a name. This intrigues the others, but Mal deflects the question. Doloris stands up for her and pointing out Mal's past is no one's business.

Doloris and Mal leave the table and have another look at the map. Doloris tells Mal that it is the Briarblaze Heart and someone else is after it too, as she learned from her patron, Lady Melora. They get to work on deciphering the map and manage to make some more progress. They learn that the sky on the scroll points to a date connected to Lady Melora, named Wild's Grandeur, which is on an equinox on the 20th day of third month. They figure they have just missed that mark, as it's early spring now. 

They manage to take that day and the sky pictured on the scroll, which seems to point to a more specific location on the Menagerie Coast, the Lushgut Forest. Doloris recalls stories of Melora fighting Zehir and Bane there. The forest itself was a prison created by Melora to keep followers of Zehir and Bane locked in. Also heard rumours about hundreds of Melora's followers who sacrificed themselves during this battle, which seem related to the hands depicted in the Briarblaze symbol.

## Looking for _business_

Later that morning, we head out to find an audience with Gellan Primewater in the Restless Wharf. Some time later, we find ourselves at a townhouse called Primewater Hall, which clearly stands out from the other buildings. It looks out over the canal and a park and has a greenhouse next to it.

![[primewater-hall.png]]

We knock on the door, and a half-elven man opens the door. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] asks if he might be Mr Primewater. The man tells his name is Ezekiel, an assistant to [[Gellan Primewater|Mr. Primewater]], and asks if we have an appointment. Mal says we don't have one, but that we would like to discuss business, having goods for trade. Ezekiel invites us inside on the prospect of some business, and goes to ask if Mr. Primewater has some interest.

![[primewater-hall-inside.png]]

Inside we are asked to wait in the hall, while Ezekiel inquires with Mr. Primewater. We are invited in and find Mr. Primewater having his breakfast, and he asks why the wanted to speak to him. Mal introduces us and explains we are from a new ship in town, the Serpent's Tide, looking to make a deal to trade some goods. Gellan seems interested after hearing what goods we have for trade, and could send one of his contacts to come by later and seal the deal. Then Mr. Primewater inquires why we came to him specifically and Mal replies that we heard good stories about him, that he is good for his people. Primewater confirms that the people of the Restless Wharf have had a rough time rebuilding and tries to take care of them. 

Then Mr. Primewater mentions that he will send Mr. Orlan to come by to make the deal. He asks if there’s anything else he can help them with, seemingly picking up on the group perhaps wanting to ask more, but they play it safe, deciding to first see how this first trade goes. They do say that, if the first trade does go well, they’ll be interested in doing more business later down the line.

We head back to the ship to wait for Orlan, and after about half an hour he shows up, looking as pale as he was described. The crew invite him on the ship and he starts inspecting the wares, offering 1800gp for the ale and spices. The figures he is lowballing a bit on the offer, but we agree with it, conveying the message that we see this as an investment into a future relationship. Orlan says that they are indeed looking forward to future transactions. The crew call in one of the [[Zhelezo]] guards to oversee the transactions. The Zhelezo guard is overseen by a member of the [[Golden Chain]], a dragonborn by the name of [[First Sergeant Brehkan]]. The two of them take the 720gp worth of taxes and then leave the ship. We are left with 1080gp which goes directly in the ship's coffer.

## Hit the Myriad in the temple

After making the trade, the crew inform the captain of their plans of fighting the Myriad later that night. He agrees it’s a smart idea to secure that smuggling route, and it’s worth the trouble. There’s a brief discussion on how to best approach the Myriad situation, but Stormbreaker cuts the discussion short by suggesting they just go there, taking Doloris' earlier route through the Blushing Mermaid.

There, Doloris walks up to the familiar face of the barkeep and greets him. The half-orc barkeep introduces himself as Droon. Doloris asks if they could gain access to the Undercellar again, but Droon is a bit reluctant, seeing her come back with a larger group this time. Doloris replies that she intends to defend the temple from some people, but Droon is suspicious who we are actually defending the temple from. Eventually he is willing to let the group down, but they note they got some strange vibes from him.

[[T'hau]] and [[Stormbreaker]] head back up again, but find that the gate has already been locked behind them again. Stormbreaker tries to break through the gate, but [[T'hau]] manages to slip past the gate by summoning their echo inside the inn and teleporting to its location. T'hau asks if Droon could open up the gate again, as they had a few more questions they wanted to ask him.

Stormbreaker and T'hau start confronting the barkeep on the signals they picked up from him, eventually admitting that it is the Myriad who run the Undercellar. The atmosphere in the inn gets a bit uneasy as some folks around them start standing up and turn their faces towards this conversation. Droon calms the clientele down and mentions he reports to the Myriad who gains access through the Blushing Mermaid. Figuring this would be bad for the crew, they strongly advise Droon to not inform the Myriad this time. Droon, sufficiently threatened, eventually agrees to keep his mouth shut in exchange for a supply of rum, which the crew promise him they’ll eventually get to him. He also tells them that, when asked, they should tell that they came in through lot 32 on The Wide as its lock was broken a couple of months ago. After some final threats, the crew head down the tunnel again towards the temple.

[[Sister Pherria]] greets us as we arrive, and tells us she is glad to see us. Has had a good talk with Lurandell, and they thinks that the Revelry is a better bet than the Myriad. Pherria hands us some lanterns to lead us through the temple. The lanterns light images of constellations on the ceiling, with Doloris and Mal recognising some of them as being very close to those depicted on the scroll. 

Walking through the tunnels of the Undercellar, we can hear rushing water from up ahead. [[Sister Pherria]] leads us to the entrance that the Myriad will be using to smuggle their wares and tells us the Myriad would be coming in by boat, then diving through the sea towards the entrance. Pherria leaves us to head back to the temple, and the crew start scouting out the area and discuss tactics.
