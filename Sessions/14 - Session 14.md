T’hau can’t sleep, finding themselves on deck of the Dragonfly, staring out over the ocean. He’s pouring over a map and an old book he found in the naval academy. The Wild Rose’s quartermaster is the author of the book.

> Captain Valeria has ordered her first expedition of the Crystalfen Caverns. The strange telepathic lure that bosun Caldoun felt seemed to eminate from there, at least... according to the Thaumatic compass. I've pressed upon the captain how dangerous this might be, but she insisted we still send the dinghey out. She has decided to lead the expedition herself, so I'll take command of the Rose until she gets back.
> 
> I sure hope they can find a cause for Caldouns' catathonic state. Although I suppose it's not fully catathonic seing as he keeps repeating the word 'Salar'.

> 18 Horisal, 532 PD.
> The Wild Rose is on it's way back to Emons harbors. The crew is silent. Nobody wants to talk about what happened yesterday. Everybody on that dinghey came back different. Captain Valeria has her bright moments, as do the rest, but i've caught her many times just staring in the middle distance. Like she doesn't seem aware on what plane she is on anymore. 
> 
> I'm not sure but I think it's a condition that is worsened by Ruidus. Last night the entire dinghey crew seemed completely out of it whenever that horrible moon showed it self from behind the clouds.

> Ruidus made it worse. The Rose now lies at the bottom of Slumber Reef in dagger bay. Me and the other survivors marked it with a red buoy. For any future expedition to the wreck that hopes to find information about what happened; you will find only death. 

Everyone eventually gets some sleep and they all wake up the following morning. Mal suggests that, if they want to make their way back to Nicodranas, they could see if they can get aboard the Serpent’s Tide, pretend to have been aboard the whole time. Doloris sends a message to Captain Cassian to arrange a rendez-vouz.

They set off aboard the Dragonfly, traveling towards where they roughly agreed to meet up with the Serpent’s Tide. The two ships meet in the night, the two captains greeting each other heartily. 

They catch the captain up with what happened at the Golden Chain vault. He tells them the mission for Primewater went well too.

Meanwhile, the council meeting is taking place. Alvaro is accompanied by a servant, Mister Orsino Navarr. He addresses the council, having his servant read out some of the agreement of the city of Nicodranas. He then turns to Eda, asking her if she’s ever been arrested, before bringing up a charge against her. Eda protests this charge, claiming it’s bullshit, but Alvaro says the charge is real and was hand-delivered to him by Lorenzo, the son of Alamad Haddou, the previous client of Eda.  

Alvaro continues by saying he thinks Eda is unfit to serve as a councillor, especially considering what happened in the Skews not a week ago. He presents the council with an ultimatum: they have one hour to disband, apprehend Eda Donegal so that she may be tried for her crimes, and accept their new marquis: Lord Guillaume de Montfort.

The room erupts in protests, which Alvaro shuts down. He tells to Navarr, telling him to get the man-hunt for the terrorist that attacked the Golden Chain vault under way, and then begins walking away. Primewater speaks up before he leaves the room, claiming he has proof that de Montfort is as tied to the Nine Hells as Uludan was.

Later that day, the crew approaches Nicodranas. Through thick smoke hanging low on the ground, Doloris notes that the Restless Wharf is in ruins. There’s a discussion about options, with T’hau eventually suggesting that they should set fire to the two man-o-wars clearly responsible for what happened here. The others are quick to agree, none of them okay with sitting idly by. 

They quickly decide to put this plan into action now, as they still have cover of the thick smoke hanging over the Restless Wharf. The captain and the rest of the crew will continue casually sailing, delivering their goods to Primewater as if nothing is amiss, whilst the others divide themselves up into two group: Stormbreaker and Rayna are one group, T’hau, Mal and Doloris are another. The two groups slip into the water unnoticed and approach the two man-o-wars from underwater. 

Stormbreaker and Rayna approach the Chimera, as T’hau, Mal and Doloris approach the Adjudicator. Stormbreaker and T’hau get ready to open one of the gunports, the two groups sharing a nod before they both try and enter simultaneously. 

Stormbreaker, with crab!Rayna on his shoulder, manages to enter in a not very subtle way, knocking a cannon back into a deckhand below deck. T’hau and Mal have better luck opening the cannon hole on their ship quietly, finding the deck largely empty. 

Stormbreaker opens the door that leads down, setting down crab!Rayna and attempting to grab the attention of any other crew through the door. Stormbreaker tells the crew aboard, as well as Vidorant, who is aboard this ship, that they’ve been found guilty of firing on an innocent city, and they have roughly twenty four seconds until the ship is set on fire.
T’hau, Mal and Doloris enter the ship as well, running into some deckhands, soldiers, as well as a half-orc member of the Enchanted Gale. 

Meanwhile, Rayna makes her way down to where the gunpowder locker is, dropping her wildshape and casting burning hands on the locker area as Stormbreaker continues keeping Vidorant busy.

An elf rushes onto the deck where T’hau, Mal and Doloris are, throwing daggers at T’hau and his echo. Mal takes a tinderbox and a torch from the bag of holding and jumps down a deck towards the gunpowder locker.  

Aboard the Chimera, Rayna manages to set fire to the gunpowder locker, the explosion shaking the ship. Stormbreaker spots Navarr, Alvaro’s spy master, who falls down some stairs. Realizing the ship may be going down, Vidorant runs, Navarr running after him once he scrambles to his feet as well. He locks eyes with Stormbreaker though, clearly recognising him. Stormbreaker and Rayna manage to make it out, Stormbreaker using Sheila to thunder step them to safety, though Rayna and her lack of swimming skills disagree about the ‘safety’ bit. 

Mal manages to set fire to the gunpowder locker aboard the Adjudicator, even if she’s initially thwarted by the mage. She re-sets fire to the room before jumping out the hole in the side of the Adjudicator. Doloris hears pounding on a door somewhere, rushing towards it. She breaks the door open, finding Eda Donegal inside. Together with Eda, Doloris and T’hau find a way outside of the ship and into the water.

As the crew gathers in the water, Doloris spots men in armor on the docks seemingly upset, but the regular people behind them are cheering. The crew swim away towards the rendez-vous point they previously agreed upon with the captain. 

Some three hours later, the Serpent’s Tide shows up at the rendez-vous point and everyone climbs on board. The Captain shares it was complete chaos as they left, adding that, from what they could see, the Chimera has completely sunk. The Adjudicator linked it’s way to relative safety and may be salvageable. 

The captain then shares some of what Primewater told him, Eda also adding her story of what happened during the council meeting. After Primewater attempted to present Alvaro with proof of de Montfort’s devilish loyalties, Alvaro was left unconvinced. Sherome then objected, insisting that she should be marquis instead. This led to discussions and arguments, which eventually crossed Alvaro’s timeline given of one hour, and so he opened fire on the Restless Wharf. 

Primewater got away, though he was injured; the captain believes he should recover just fine. 

The captain then presents the crew with some money as well as a ledger that Primewater gave to him. It’s the ‘dirt’ that Primewater has been gathering on his colleagues for the last couple of years. 

The conversation then turns to what they should do next. The Captain says he’s been in touch with the Plank Queen, who mentioned hiring some soldiers to take on the city of Nicodranas. The crew agrees that not heading back to Nicodranas at least for a little while is likely the smartest, though some of them want to go back now and start a full on rebellion. Mal suggests that Port Damali could be an option; they could find out more about what Alvaro was doing there. 

Doloris turns to Eda to ask for her opinion: she thinks they’re now in open war with the Concord.
