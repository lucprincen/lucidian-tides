Combat starts at the Cobalt Reserve. Isol puts the fire out properly after the last Zhelezo flee the building. They seek out Cobalt Soul leadership to talk about what happened, Elkael the wizard joining them, as well as Darmin.  

Aboard the ship, Rayna and Mal talk about how weird the crew is. They then seek out the others, Rayna wanting to try out if she can ‘make Stormbreaker move somewhere he doesn’t want to go’, as Mal told her he likely wouldn’t. She takes the point a little too literally, but does manage to push Stormbreaker down to the ground, slightly aided by the fact he seems drunk. 

T’hau shares a moment with Remy about being normal as the others head downstairs for drinks, T’hau and Remy eventually joining as well to keep an eye on the others.  

Next day, Rayna speaks to the flying monkey, who shares he’s getting older and trying to carefully pick his friends. The monkey, Old Yelper, says some more scratches and food would be appreciated, which Mal and Rayna agree to give him.

At night fall, various jagged rocks can be seen piercing out of the surf ahead. They start navigating the Torrid Reef.  

First day goes relatively well, they lay anchor in a reef where there’s relatively quiet torrents. The following day, they continue their journey. Mal reads the currents to try and help the ship navigate them, guiding them on their way. They’re hit by a bubble of hot air, but continue onwards. T’hau sends their echo ahead to scout along with their reef shark. 

They manage to navigate out of sudden currents as well as a large amounts of kelp. Rayna casts Speak with Plants to speak to the kelp, asking it to move aside. It does, the ship gliding through with no issue. 

At the end of the day, they spot land ahead, having reached their destination of the Snout of Omgar. As they approach, two geysers erupt on the island. 

As they get closer, chunks of crystal seem to hit the ship, almost like ice, but not clear enough to actually be ice. They seem to be massive chunks of glass, floating on the water. 

They move the ship in a little closer, before the group gets onto a rowboat to cover the final bit of the journey to land. The captain joins them. As they reach shore, they can see where the glass came from; there are massive flowers of glass on the beach, indicating lightning strikes. As they look up, they can see a massive storm cloud incoming.
