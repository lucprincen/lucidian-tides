The captain explains they found empty quarters and droplets of slime. He came back from the Cobalt Reserve with a book, locked himself in his room and started reading. The book is still there, the group goes to investigate. 

The pages that are open are blank. The book is written in Naush, so Mal casts Comprehend Languages to translate. Book title is Voices of Salar, written by Karaline von Ethro. It talks about the city of Salar, aboleths, how they were here before the Gods and how it’s located close to Emon. It talks about a sovereign named Durrom a lot and how this society fell apart during the Calamity. As the book goes on, there’s mention of creature called Iluun. It mentions Iluun being an aboleth.

The creature is credited as a source, which refers to the blank pages in the book. Mal notes a magical sheen of sorts on the blank pages, pointing this and all of everything else out to everyone. Rayna dispels the magic on the pages, seemingly opening up a portal of sorts in the book that starts spewing out mucus and slime. 

Taking a look at everything, Doloris deduces that whatever was in this pocket dimension attached to the book lived in sea water, and T’hau may have accidentally summoned it by summoning his echo. He then seems to have left with whatever this thing was.

The crew discusses how to find T’hau after the tracks of slime turn out hard to track. As they’re discussing this, someone boards the ship from the water: a female sea elf who claims she’s just here visiting an old friend. She wears a talisman around her neck showing the symbol of Ioun. 

She introduces herself as Alma, she knows T’hau from a long time ago. They tell her what they think happened to T’hau. Sage Ahvoste, presumably of the Cobalt Soul, warned T’hau about the book. The group decides to head to the Cobalt Reserve, as they should also be able to tell them who rented the book before T’hau did.

Alma leads the way to the Cobalt Reserve, to one of the desks inside behind which an old dwarf is seated. Sage Ahvoste shares stories of the previous owner of the book, who went stark raving mad. Her name was Bendira, she still lives in the city. She often came to Tumbledown Bank to meditate on the shoreline. She used to live in the Beaded Alley. She became obsessed with freeing something called Iluun from the book.

The crew and Alma decide to head to the Tumbledowns, specifically to Tumbledown Bank to try and find Bendira. As they pass through the city, a town crier of sorts announces some recent news. Alvaro has decided to stay in Nicodranas to keep the city in order. Checks in the harbour will continue to take place.   

Passing through the Tumbledowns, it’s clear this is the poorer part of town. The crew take note of graffiti of sorts on the buildings, all seemingly mocking someone called the Sugar Man.

They reach Tumbledown Bank and the crew tries different tactics to try and find Bendira and, in Doloris’ case, Iluun. Mal finds a woman who seems to know of Bendira, the parrot circling above the woman’s head confirming as much. The woman says that Bendira has moved to the Pellet, an island just off shore. Stormbreaker knows this used to be a smuggling location that the Myriad used. 

Alma, having asked around as well, shares that some people seem to have seen T’hau swimming towards the Pellet as well. She received some rude comments about T’hau and how she shouldn’t be spending time with ‘creatures like that’. 

There’s a brief discussion on how to get to the island, Rayna commandeering a surfboard as she doesn’t like to swim. Everyone else swims as Rayna propels herself across on the surfboard, Doloris holding on to it so she doesn’t sink. 

Rayna and Doloris circle around to get a better view of the island as Mal and Stormbreaker take the ramp up towards the center of the island. The former two take note of an old watch tower, Doloris also spotting a cavern, though its hard to see inside it due to the high level of the water.

Mal and Stormbreaker stand before an overgrown entrance. Stones are decorated with various local creatures. A large lizard with six legs is asleep atop the entrance. They both recognise this as a basilisk. 

The crew reconvenes, Doloris suggesting she can cast Silence on the basilisk. The others agree this is a good idea. Mal picks up on some noise from down below, then also notes some footsteps in the dust on the island, as well as a speck of slime. They decide to follow the ‘goop’, moving further onto the island.

They head down, accidentally setting off a trap, the narrow pathway down eventually leads to a pool of water. The ceiling is being held up by ornate pillars. The water smells horrible. As they head into the water, something emerges from the water, rushing their way.
Combat. 

They defeat the three creatures that attacked them, both Mal and Stormbreaker getting pulled under at some point. With the fight over, Stormbreaker finds himself struggling to breathe, Doloris quickly casting Lesser Restoration on him, which helps. 

They keep going. Around the corner, there’s a small beach with three statues. The statues are half buried. All three are women, the middle one has huge angelic wings that are spread out, almost long enough to touch the other two. The two statues on the outside seem to depict Melora and Avandra, the one in the center depicts the same symbol as the Briarblaze Heart. Some of the group recognise the sculptures are in the style of the Ki’Nau. 
Doloris recognises the face of the middle statue as that of her angelic guide.

Then, the double doors to the north open. Everyone takes a defensive position as the doors slowly open and from them emerges, T’hau. He doesn’t quite look like himself.
