On the way back, Doloris notices the water lighting up with a strange green color. She’s reminded of an old memory, from when she was eight years old. There’s a lot going on around her, which she tries to ignore. She’s helping load up the Heartbreaker, her father’s ship. Something snaps and there’s a sharp pain to her temple as she falls overboard. She’s met with darkness. When she opens her eyes, she’s aboard a long slender ship, in a rocky underground waterway. There’s a figure behind her, moving the boat forward with a large wooden oar. His face has skeletal features. 

She asks the creature where she is, where her father is. It doesn’t respond. Doloris looks over the edge of the ship, but there’s nothing of note in the water. There’s a glow in the water coming from all sorts of different spectres and creatures drawing past. It’s scary, but she’s determined not to let that show. 

She starts shouting at the skeleton, her voice echoing around her. The figure stops, looking straight at her. It still doesn’t respond, but it points ahead, where the waterway starts to bend and open up into a larger cavern. It opens up before them, with banks on both sides where the spectres try to crawl back out, but fail to do so.

In front of the boat, she sees a clothed individual, deep underwater, guiding some of these spectres. There are partly rotting angel wings and when the creature approaches some of the spectres, they illuminate for a moment, some of them managing to make it to shore, others becoming more ethereal and disappearing.

Then, she hears a voice in her head. “My child, what brings you here? You’re not supposed to be here. You don’t belong here.” Doloris asks where she is, the creature asking her how familiar she is with the afterlife. “My father always says, dead is dead,” Doloris responds. The creature says their name is Uqaviel the Recreant; they will make it their personal mission to make sure she’s send back. “Forget this happened. Rise.” When Doloris opens up her eyes again, she stares into the relieved face of her father. 

As they enter the harbor, the captain and some of the crew wave them over, so they dock near the ship. They board the ship, the captain catching them up on what he found out. Some people did see the message left behind, but about 90% of the people who saw it don’t care or are on the Revelry’s side. They bribed the other 10%, which cost them about 300 gold. Most of that bribe went to a ship mostly manned by halflings, called the Mimsey. Falphar Proudfoot is the captain of that ship; they don’t trust him to keep his mouth shut. They also know they should be leaving tomorrow. 
There’s some discussion on how to handle this. 

After some time, Big Neela returns with a coffin for Bartholomew. They wrap Bartholomew up, placing him in the coffin. They move him to the Hydra, so they can sail out to sea and give him a sea man’s grave. Everyone takes turns saying goodbye to Bartholomew. Mal thanks him for bestowing his knowledge on the younger crew of the ship. Doloris says she hopes he’s at rest. Rayna says she’ll miss his random old man stories. 

The captain says he knew Bartholomew for some thirty years. They were crew together, before making their way up the ranks of the Revelry. “He had a knack for tempting fate and it’s sad that in the end it wasn’t fate that did him in”. 

Stormbreaker steps forward last, pouring some rum over the casket before taking a swig himself. He mentions a story about a ship from the Emerald Gulch, that spelled Doom. The captain of this ship was a dwarf, who was rumored to have died, or maybe he found love. “It’s probably a coincidence…”  Everyone picks up the casket together and give Bartholomew his final farewell. Rayna sets fire to the casket, which eventually dips below the water. 

They head back to harbor, docking the ship again and heading to the pub where Guiseppe said he would be, the Low Lantern. The Low Lantern is an old ship with a pub inside. A lot of people are seated outside, enjoying the warm weather. There are four people behind the bar, led by the Captain, a human woman with long curly hair. The crew heads upstairs, which is also where Guiseppe is. They tell him where he can find his boat, thanking him for lending it to them by buying him some drinks. 

They toast to Bartholomew. Then discuss what to do next, figuring out how to best transport the gold they intend on stealing. Doloris realises a nearby table seems vaguely interested in their conversation. Stormbreaker and Mal head over to see what has them so interested. A half-orc does the talking, but the elf speaks up as well. The elf admits they overheard them talking about vasts amounts of gold, this caught their attention. 

They talk about how life has been hard, their own wages aren’t exactly anything to write home about. Stormbreaker can tell the elf speaks the truth, but he’s not telling the full truth; there’s some pain behind his voice as well. They admit they overheard them mention the Golden Chain as well; they hold no love for them. 

Stormbreaker continues this conversation, the elf admitting that most people in the Skew and the Restless Wharf not liking the Golden Chain much. The elf then introduces himself as Istran, the others are Ziraj (orc), Tash and Feera (humans). Stormbreaker and Mal deduce these men are harmless, disgruntled workers who likely won’t turn on them. They leave the table by telling the men not to worry, Mal assuring them change is coming. 

After some more drinks, they return to the ship. Agree to head to Primewater tomorrow to tell him they’ve looked into the bones. They also intend to ask him about a good place to meet with Ida, as they’re interested in helping those in the Skew as well. Before bed, they decide at least two people should be on watch at all times, considering what happened to Bartholomew. 

During the last watch, Rayna spots a figure climbing on deck of the Mimsey. It’s a figure with the upper body of a shark and the lower body of a humanoid. He drops something out of his mouth before turning into a halfling. 

In the morning, Rayna shares what she saw with the rest of the crew. Mal thinks it might be a lycanthrophy-like situation. She also knows that whilst most of the Clovis Concord doesn’t necessarily frown upon lycanthrophy, within the Golden Chain it’s grounds for dismissal. 
Mal talks to Rayna about the ‘you didn’t tell me being a pirate was dangerous’ letter she wrote to her. This turns into a discussion on teaching Rayna how to swim. 

They head to Gellan Primewater early in the morning, informing him about the bones in the water. He thanks them and they seem to have established trust with him. He offers them a new mission: he reminds them he said to meet up with Ida and with de Montfort. He suggests they all come to the council meeting that night, meet Ida, see the other councillors; they can sit in the public area.

He goes on to say that Lord de Montfort is tricky; he’s sometimes with them, sometimes against them. He mentions a private enterprise in the Sunless Sea, near the Quoraska Cape, that the de Montfort family used to run, before Avernus happened. He suggests they can find dirt on this, and thus convince de Montfort to be more on their side. He sent a team down there a few weeks ago, but hasn’t heard from them since. 

The location of the Quoraska Cape sends Stormbreaker into a memory. He smells gunpowder. They’d been lying in wait for some ships and though less ships arrived than expected, they sprung the trap. Through the smoke of gunpowder, Stormbreaker seems flags going up: the international sign of refugees on board. 

He’s asked if they should continue firing; Stormbreaker says no, but Captain Alvaro tells his crew to ignore Stormbreaker’s order. Alvaro seems to think it’s a ruse, the cannons all around them going off.

It wasn’t long after this that Stormbreaker learned of Nicodranas’ fate shortly after this, making the refugee story all the more likely. The Heartbreaker and the Banshee’s Wail were the ships sunk that day. The Mad Siren is the ship that was expected to also be there, but wasn’t.       

Mal asks if it’s not common knowledge that the de Montfort’s were in Avernus; this news seems to surprise Primewater. They apparently tell a story of having been visiting business relations in Marquet at that time. Mal admits she sadly has no proof of them having struck a deal in Avernus. They agree to head to to the council meeting later that day.

They head into town to do some shopping, heading to Sorcerous Sundries in White Cliffs. Two story building with a large white facade and a mosaic tiled roof. A half-elven woman in a fancy crimson dress greets them as they enter. They ask about a Bag of Holding, which the woman says she doesn’t have right now. People tend to come here moreso for magically enhanced clothing. She acts a little weird, writing something down on a piece of paper, which Mal reads: “We’re being watched, meet me in the alley out back in ten minutes”. The group leaves, heading to the alley.

The half elf meets them there, introducing herself as Celia. The person who rents the shop place asks her to track people buying bigger items like that, and she doesn’t want that. She tells them that she doesn’t have the bag still, but there’s people in the area who can make items like this. But the sell of it is illegal and heavily controlled. Lady Sherome controls these sales. 

There is a dwarven woman called Okoria Stonemarrow in the Skews, who Celia and three other shop owners come together with every week to craft items, off the books. She suggests they visit Stonemarrow’s Potions in the Skews. There, they can share the specifics of what their Bag of Holding should look like and for 400 gold they will make it for them.

They look into some things to provide some extra protection aboard the ship, like a bell, smaller bells below decks as well as more lanterns, including a Lantern of Revealing. The latter they also ask Celia and her friends for.
