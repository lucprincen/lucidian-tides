The Serpent’s Tide has been en route to Port Damali for three days. They spot a storm near Port Zoon, as well as a pair of sails near the horizon. The ship bears the flag of Nicodranas, with heraldry of House de Montfort. The crew briefly discusses, deciding to try and ‘lay low’ and see what happens, as Mal points out it’s technically a merchant vessel. 
The name of the ship is the Oroboriosa, with the figurehead of a woman and two snakes. It sails past without making any aggressive moves. 

The crew discusses pastries and surfing shenanigans.

Doloris manages to cut some time off their journey by plotting a different course. They pass by the Twinward Isles. From the islands, they see a group of furry, flying creatures: tiny flying monkeys. They dive down towards the ship, two of them stealing an eyepatch from Remmi, most of them flying off after this attempt. 

Mal takes over the crow’s nest from Remmi, one of the monkeys making its way up to her and staring at her. Doloris goes to find Rayna to ask for her help with dealing with the monkeys. Mal feeds the flying monkey that’s still staring at her, and it sticks around. 

Eventually, they reach Tyoden Bay, where Port Damali is located. The military presence of the Clovis Concord is immediately visible in the harbor. It strikes Stormbreaker as strange there’s such a big presence here; this sort of presence blocks commerce, which the city wonn’t like. 

They decide to approach and ask entry to port, and are asked to wait. Most of the crew hide underneath the ship as Rayna wildshapes into a monkey, watching what goes on aboard the deck. 

Eventually, a figure steps aboard, accompanied by some troops. Its an older, human male, with burly eyebrows and a goatee. He doesn’t look like he’s enjoying his current work. He introduces himself as Monseigneur Zinda, the harbormaster. He asks to speak to the captain, who steps forward. The captain explains they’re looking for some trade here, as well as some respite. Zinda and his troops inspect the ship, commenting on how empty the hold is. The captain comes up with an excuse that Zinda seems to believe.
The others attempt to stay hidden underneath the ship, Rayna spotting some other ship wardens aboard a different ship peering over the railing, seemingly having spotted something underneath the Serpent’s Tide.

Still as a monkey, Rayna makes her way over there to try and steal one of their hats, hoping to pose a distraction. It seems to work. She runs off and back to safety. 


Eventually, Zinda and his men take their leave and the Serpent’s Tide is allowed to sail into port. 

The Larboard Light harbour is on the smaller side, but lavish. There are smaller riverboats positioned there to bring goods further into the city. Some of these boats are pulled by large rhineceri. The harbor is flanked on side by the airship docks, and on the other side by a massive keep, Boulderkeep. 

The ones hiding underwater manage to climb on board out of view, and the ship is assigned to a berth. The captain already paid the docking fees. It is now late afternoon. 

T’hau excuses himself to head to the Cobalt Reserve, as he has some research to do. Those more familiar with Port Damali point him in the right way, before the others head towards the Beaded Alley in search of, amongst other things, pastries.

They find their way to Damali’s Delights, the bakery owned by Mal’s uncle, Yves. Yves is surprised to see Mal, but welcomes her with a hug as Stormbreaker attempts to sneak past to grab some pastries, but is instantly caught. Mal quickly briefs Yves on some of what happened in Nicodranas, before Yves calls down his husband, Elias. Introductions are made and the group is offered tea and freshly made pastries. 

Over said tea and pastries, Mal asks her uncles about Alvaro’s activities within the cities. She mentions priests of certain goddesses, her uncle saying a specific priestess of Avandra did get taken to the Boulderkeep. The increased activity in the harbor is because of the ‘terrorist activities’ in Nicodranas. The marquis here has her own private army: the Blood Sails, all previous Revelry members now in the privateering business, who left port a few days ago. Twelve ships worth. 

Before long, Lea, Mal’s sister, and her husband, Destrian, arrive as well, with fresh groceries. Lea and her sister share a hug and Mal is pleasantly surprised to find that her sister is pregnant. 

Over the course of dinner, Mal shares most everything that has happened over the last couple of weeks with her family. Elias is the only one to voice some concern, which Mal understands. She promises she doesn’t aim to get them in any trouble, and asks about somewhere they can find magical disguises.
Her uncle points her to Lucinian’s Scriptorium, a magic shop that focuses mostly on scrolls, but they should have some other items as well.  

Yves also points out that, if they aim to seek out similar-minded people within Port Damali, they should be careful. The only place that he thinks is relatively safe for them to ask around for help of the more ‘criminal’ kind is The Red Ring. 
They are invited to stay the night, though they are warned that a baker’s life comes with an early rise the following morning. 

The following morning, the crew awake to fresh pastries. After breakfast, they make their way towards Lucinian’s Scriptorium, Yves promising to take them to the temple later. 
They enter the magic shop, rows and rows of scroll tubes surrounding them. A young gnome, Lucinian, walks around the space, with big burly eyebrows, brown hair, and three different pairs of glasses on his nose. 
They all look around the shop, spotting a number of interesting looking items: a cloak, a shield, some other things.

Mal asks for something that can help disguise her. Doloris asks for something that can help disguise multiple people; the shopkeep grabs a deck of cards that holds illusions. As Mal asks how much the cape is, Doloris wanders over to the shield, taking a closer look at it. 
The Cloak of Disguise is 600 gold. The shield is magical, formerly belonging to a paladin of Avandra. It’s a Shield of the Hidden Path. The shield is 3000 gold. He also has a Ring of Protection for 700 gold. There’s also a ‘water ring’, for 1800 gold. It allows its wearer to breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed, but as Rayna looks at it, she quickly figures out it’s very cursed. 

Rayna points out it’s not very nice to sell them a cursed ring, suggesting they pay 3500 gold for the combination of the cloak, the shield, the Ring of Protection and the Deck of Illusions. The shopkeep agrees and the crew buy the cloak, the ring, the shield and the deck of cards.

They then head back towards the bakery, Yves meeting them outside, ready to guide them towards the Pearl Shine temple to Avandra. The temple is massive, surrounded by statues of elven figures looking out into the distance. There are numerous places of prayers, the group noting the name Alkhamar on a specific area of the building. Yves pointed out before that the Alkhamar family is very involved in the temple, as well as in a lot of city affairs.

The group is eventually approached by an elder pallid elf, an acolyte of the temple. Mal shares they heard of what happened to their priestess, adding they’ve heard rumors of other attempts at kidnapping religious leaders. The elf asks if these other leaders were followers of the Wildmother, which Mal confirms. The pallid elf pulls another acolyte into the conversation. The two of them share a look, the pallid elf saying she thinks Navarr is after what’s buried in the Lushgut Forest. 

The elf asks why they’re interested in this, Rayna claiming they’re concerned citizens, Mal adding she and Doloris are also followers of the Wildmother. The elf leads them to a more secure location, down to cold catacombs that look ancient. 

The elf explains that Navarr, Alvaro’s spymaster, came to this shrine a couple of times in the past weeks, asking about the Lushgut Forest. That place is held sacred and secret by the followers of Avandra and the Wildmother; they buried something there. The elf shares they dread that the regime has started using torture and other ways to get the information about the Lushgut Forest out of the head priestess. She thinks they wish to find a path towards what’s buried there. 

She’s initially a little vague, but Mal and Doloris let her know that they already know what she’s talking about. The elf shares that the Briarblaze Heart, the thing hidden in the Lushgut Forest, constricts and contains the last fanatical soldiers of the Strife Emperor as well as the Cloaked Serpent. The Wildmother and the Changebringer fought them together, there, in the Lushgut Forest; it’s where they held their last stand. The forest is held up by magic, it is meant to be a maze, people are meant to get lost in it.  

Some followers of Avandra and the Wildmother are allowed in. Many of the pallid elves also know ways into the forest. There are a few maps to the Briarblaze heart, and a few routes. 
Doloris suggests trying to get to the Briarblaze Heart, Mal saying it seems like it’s in a pretty safe location. The elf says that, if they have a map, they might be able to get to the other maps. There are seven in total; each contains clues on where to find the others. There’s some discussion on how to best approach this. 

The elf says there is one person in the city with enough pull in the Concord: Alkhamar. He may be able to help the crew. The elf says she can make an introduction; he is very wealthy, and very well connected. Though Doloris expresses some doubt in how much they could trust this man, they still agree that meeting up with Alkhamar might be a good idea.
The pallid elf, Nightwarden Quarril, sends a runner to make an appointment with Alkhamar. Said runner returns some time later, saying Alkhamar can meet with them the following morning.  

The crew head back towards the ship, passing by the bakery on the way back to grab some fresh pastries. Part of the crew is out into town, though the captain and Remmi are still aboard the ship, seemingly looking for something. When they ask them what’s going on, the captain says he thinks they lost T’hau.
