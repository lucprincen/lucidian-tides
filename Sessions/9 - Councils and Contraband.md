Earlier that day, T’hau peeled off from the rest of the group to try and find some more information on the aboleth. Mal and Doloris suggest a library or a school would be the best source of information - Mal recalls a naval academy that used to be in the Open Quay. Stormbreaker is familiar with the place as well, he suggests T’hau asks for Klilla.
T’hau heads towards the Open Quay. They walk past a building in disarray, with a lot of scaffolding outside. They head inside, finding the door open. In the hallway, there’s a statue of a distinguished looking gentleman holding a spyglass. A scruffy looking tabaxi walks past as T’hau enters. 

T’hau asks for Klilla; they’re pointed to the library. There’s a massive black soot stain on the library, a lot of book cases seem to be missing. There is a small desk though, with an aarakocra sitting at it, wearing a robe and small spectacles on her beak. This is Klilla Agrupnin. T’hau tells her what kind of information they’re looking for, describing an underwater civilization of evil creatures. She points them to some scrolls, that also include some maps. 

T’hau starts by looking at where they think they escaped from. They know they came from the coast near the Iron Authority, heading north east from there, following a large shipping line. They don’t see any large remnants of civilizations near there, though there are the Ruins of Tempestar near there, an underwater ruin. 

Eventually, they find a mention of Salar in a nautical map of the western coast of Tal’Dorei, specifically near the city of Emon, below the Ozmit Sea. T’hau is eventually asked to leave as the library is closing, so they’re unable to look much further into this. Taking the maps with them is not an option right now. 

The others wrap up business with Okoria around the same time. Okoria is an old dwarven lady, dressed in fine wizardry robes with a thick, stubbly beard and a large nose. She agrees to take their order and tells them that the circle should be getting together the following evening, she will send a message when they’re done. 

The group discusses attending the council meeting, Rayna asking Mal if she wants to attend, as she likely doesn’t want to get recognised by some people. Mal shares with the others that her full name is Louise de Montfort, and her parents think she’s dead. She reiterates what she told Primewater as well; her parents were in Avernus and made a deal to leave early. They left her behind and think she’s dead. After some discussion they decide on a big hat and big cloak as a disguise for Mal. 

Before the meeting, Mal seeks out Ava to talk to her. She finds her having dinner at the Helm & Cloak, gesturing for her to come over. Mal tells her not to tell anyone about her still being alive. Also asks her about Ribbons, mentioning Heltar and how Mal suspects he’s involved with the Myriad. Ava immediately seems to want to get involved, but Mal warns her not to, telling her what happened to Bartholomew. Mal soon excuses herself, Ava suggesting she stay up on the balcony during the council meeting, as that’s more obscured.    


They all head towards the council meeting at the High Hall. As they head there, they note a lot of shouting in the streets of the Skews. There’s a group of people, led by a hobgoblin, who’s being followed by some eighteen people as he’s dragging something across the streets. The people behind him are hoisting a coffin over their heads. The hobgoblin is dragging a dwarf across the street, covered in coal stains. The mob is chanting about justice for Nivor. 

Mal knows that Nivor is a tannery in the Skews. It’s near where the dwarves claimed a mine. 
The mob moves past them. They spot the orc, Ziraj, and one of the humans, Feera, from the bar last night. The hobgoblin, Dorrik, pulls a gun, at which point the crew decides to get involved.

Stormbreaker rushes into the middle of the group to draw their attention. He speaks to the hobgoblin, who points out the dwarf blew up some people the day before. Stormbreaker attempts to reason with them, the others rushing up to help him. 
The crowd drops the casket after Dorrik fires his gun in the air and they start retreating. There’s a charred corpse in the casket, which drops to the ground. 

Guards can soon be heard rushing in, the crew urging Dorrik and his friends to calm down at this point. Inbetween the guards there’s a young woman, who’s doing the talking, drawing everyone’s attention. 

The woman, Eda, addresses the dwarf, Overseer Flintguard, checking in with him. She then addresses the rest of the crowd, warning them they’ll get nowhere if they keep putting the law in their own hands. She tells them to either go home, or join her in High Hall. 
The situation resolves, Eda taking her leave and heading towards the High Hall. The crew heads the same direction after briefly discussing what happened. 

They find a spot on the balcony. The councillors are already seated, Eda and Gellan amongst them. The meeting is soon started. First on the agenda: the recent explosion in the Skews. Eda mentions the mob she crossed on her way here, noting her stance on the mines. She adds that they owe the people of the Skews some sort of justice. This sparks a discussion, mostly on the Golden Chain versus the Zhelezo investigating. 

Another point on the agenda is the demolishing of the Lavish Chateau, which is something de Montfort objects to. He calls it somewhat of a landmark and is unwilling to give up on trying to restore it, though he acknowledges that there’s been some trouble with the location. Gellan suggests they can hire someone to take a look at this, as well as Tight Peak Tower and the Grand Cemetery. 

Third point on the agenda is a new wave of immigrants from the Empire. Lady Sherome has a proposition for this: she says they shouldn’t let just everybody into the city, suggesting a stricter vetting process. Another discussion breaks out between the people in the council.
After they discuss their business, the council meeting opens up to the public. Klilla is one of the people speaking up, asking for more funds for the library. 

Stormbreaker speaks up, mentioning the explosion at the tannery, trying to poke some holes into their logic. He’s met with a lot of red tape talk from de Modesto. Before the end of the meeting, Gellan passes the gavel to Lady Sherome, who will head the next meeting. She says that they will have a guest at the next meeting: grand admiral Alvaro will be in Nicodranas to attend the party at the Golden Keep and he’ll attend the meeting the following day. The meeting is then ended.

Gellan and Eda come find the crew, speaking to them. Stormbreaker asks if they could look into the explosion, without taking the law into their own hands. Eda isn’t opposed, but does warn then to be careful. She mentions de Montfort, listing some of his political views and pointing out de Montfort’s wealth and a connection he has to the Golden Chain. Mal asks her if she knows why de Montfort cares so much about the Lavish Chateau, but she doesn’t know. Everyone heads out, the crew heading back to the ship. 

When they find their way back, Julnar says she saw a parrot flying away from the Mimsey as they set sail. It then turned invisible. 

They catch the captain up with what happened during the meeting. Tell him about Alvaro coming to town, as well as their intent to look into the explosion at the tannery. The captain says he’ll check in with Primewater himself the following day to figure out some shipments they can potentially run for him. 

They end the day by indulging in some rum. As they’re drinking their rum, Rayna sees double, two Iggys appearing in front of her. She finds herself in a memory, staring at music box. Her mother tells her that her birth father made it, Rayna pointing out she has other real fathers. Her mother then says she has a surprise for her, guiding her to the middle of the hut they’re in. She takes out a leather pouch, inside which are some seeds. “These are for you. Please keep them close, know that if you ever need help, or are feeling lonely, just think of me.” 

She tosses one of the seeds down, which starts to grow into a twig, which turns to coal before it animates into a little salamander. Her mother explains the seeds are from the City of Bras and she can always summon the salamander back if something happens to it.
Rayna asks her mother what she knows. Her mother mentions problems with visions. “Sometimes I see images of you or me and they are dark and they feel like portents,” her mother says. Rayna asks if she thinks something bad is going to happen to her. Her mother points her to the creature on her shoulder, Rayna pointing out she can sometimes take care of herself as well. She promises her mother she’ll be fine. 

The crew talk about how the world was build wrong, Rayna being somewhat cynical about it all. They talk about how people with good intentions are still around. 
Rayna points out something Stormbreaker said to Dorrik, about murder not being the answer. She says she wishes someone had been around to tell her that before. They continue the discussion on the bad things happening in the city and wanting to do something about it. The crew asks Mal about her father and the Lavish Chateau and talking about it they conclude they should look into the Lavish Chateau.

They agree to look into the chateau as well as the tannery the following day. Then continue somewhat drunken discussions on fixing things before eventually going to bed.
