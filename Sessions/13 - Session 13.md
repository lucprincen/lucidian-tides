Ava asks Mal to knock her unconscious; Mal instead suggests Ava fakes being unconscious. Mal uses druidcraft to craft some pigmented flowers, faking the bruise colors on Ava’s face. Ava warns the others the guard change will be in six minutes.

Meanwhile, Stormbreaker notes an empty spell scroll and a grappling hook on Yuzza’s body. T’hau and Doloris note some opened file cabinets in that same room. Doloris notices Temulia’s sentence on the desk: forceful abstraction. It speaks of treason and conspiracy with the Revelry. 

Rayna notes something strange about a painting, pulling it away, revealing a secret door. They move through the building towards where they know the stairs are that should lead up to the vault. 

They eventually end up in a hallway with two doors. They seem magically locked, Rayna dispels the magic on both doors. T’hau and Mal head through the door on the left as Doloris opens the door to the right, which sets off a trap. The room on the right contains seven columned vaults, the room on the left contains a number of cabinets.

T’hau starts opening some of the cabinets, finding some small pouches as well as some clothing and a strange, moon-shaped sickle made of coral. Clothing looks like fish-scales. 
Stormbreaker opens one of the vaults, finding chests inside, stacked. Inside the chest that Stormbreaker pulls out, there’s platinum. They start piling platinum into the bag of holding. 
When they realise time starts running out, they take what money they can and start running for it. As they pass by Vidorant’s office, Rayna uses Burning Hands to try and set the room on fire as a distraction. Vidorant and two guards are in there. She sets fire to some of Vidorant’s dwarven paintings.

They keep running, Mal finding her way downstairs first and finding Temulia in her cell. She looks horrible, with wilts and bruises and boils, and is accompanied by a guard Mal recognises: Devlan, who Rayna briefly spoke to a few days ago. 

Everyone continues downstairs, Rayna setting the library on fire on their way out. She spots a magical book, picking that up as they go. 

As Doloris makes her way into the room with Tamulia, her greater restoration seems to help Tamulia greatly. They continue trying to escape, more guards alerted to their presence and attempting to stop them. They eventually make their way through the fake wall in the storage room, hearing people from through the door. Mal hands Ava, who ran with the crew because the building is now partially on fire, her cloak so hopefully her Zhelezo uniform is less recognisable. 

They try to get out of town, finding themselves stuck trying to get out of the city gate. There are some circus act shenanigans, as well as seagull shenanigans, before the group notes that the Golden Vault building is now on fire. From the other side of the gate, a coach approaches with an elf aboard, who Doloris recognises as part of the Dragonfly crew. 
The Zhelezo ask why the elf is here, who claims he’s here for trade.The guards start discussing, especially with the building on fire they don’t think they should let anyone in or out. T’hau reaches out to the elf telepathically, asking him to keep the guards busy. Rayna sends in her seagulls to add a bigger distraction to the elf now causing a scene. 
Everyone else scales the wall a little further away with the help of some rope, making their way down the wall on the other side. 

They start making their way to Natchuala Bay, getting picked up by the elf halfway there. He introduces himself as Nimav. At roughly 2am that night, they make it to Natchuala Bay. They take a rowboat across to the Dragonfly, where they are greeted by everyone on board. Th’whyllian asks if anyone wants a ride to Darktow, the group decides they want to stay, regardless of whether or not they were recognised in the city. 

The crew takes a moment to catch their breath, taking a look at the items they found. Mal takes a look at the magic book Rayna found, recognising spells for Animate Dead, Circle of Death and Magic Jar. Tome of the Stilled Tongue once belonged to a former servant of Vecna. Mal also takes a look at the other items, the sickle and the scale gown; Doloris recognises it may be items belonging to the former priestess of the temple. The sickle is a Moon Sickle. The mace is a Mace of Disruption. They divide up some of the items.

Mal goes to check in with Ava, who’s looking up at the stars. She talks about how she’s vaguely considering going to Darktow, but it’s not really what she wants. They talk and agree that instead they should find a way to get Ava back in town, maybe come up with a story of how Ava was kidnapped by them. She can be the crew’s inside woman with the Zhelezo. Mal suggests she can introduce Ava to Ida and Primewater, two more ‘legitimate’ allies who aren’t pirates. Ava says she would like that. The two share a moment, looking out over the water.
